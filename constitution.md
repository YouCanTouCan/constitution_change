# Open source Club Constitution

## Preamble

The Open Source Club at The Ohio State University has had an extensive role in OSU's tech-related
student life, from sprouting into other clubs and events, to encouraging students and alumni alike
to become a part of the open source community.

The current leadership of this organization would like to extend gratitude to former members and staff;
open source has had a rich history, both in and out of OSU's campus, and it is with the support of those
who have come before us that we are able to exercise this passion so freely.

The current staff of the Open Source Club would like to acknowledge the following past members and staff for their contributions:

- Isaac Jones
- Martin Jansche
- Michael Benedict
- Andrew Cziryak
- Kyle Rosenberg
- Adrian Vovk
- Dominik Winecki

## Article I - Definition

### Section I - Name

The name of this student organization is to be "The Open Source Club at The Ohio State University."
("The Open Source Club", "OSC", "th(e/is) organization", "th(e/is) student organization")

### Section II - Purpose

This student organization will dedicate itself to introducing the open source model of
development to students; to showcasing projects developed under an open source development
model (programs, games, websites, etc.); to fostering interest in the open source community;
to allowing students to engage in discourse with other students on the topics surrounding
open source; to raising awareness of the value open source can provide people from all
walks of life; to introduce, promote, and potentially normalize a more democratic use and
development of the technology that surrounds us and will continue to do so for the years
to come.

### Section III - Non-Discrimination Policy

This organization does not discriminate on the basis of
age, ancestry, color, disability, gender identity or expression, genetic information,
HIV/AIDS status, military status, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation,
protected veteran status, or any other bases under the law, in its activities, programs,
admission, and employment.

In addition, this organization does not discriminate on the basis of academic standing,
program affiliation, nor personal political affiliation.

Finally, it is this organization's policy that these statements and policies extend to - and
will be required of - all individuals who choose to associate with this organization; student,
officer,  or otherwise.

## Article II - Membership

Passive membership is awarded to any and all individuals who display interest in the organization
to a recognizable degree. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Those who subscribe to any existing mailing lists.
- Those who interact with any existing social media accounts.
- Those who are members of any existing social groups (Discord, Revolt, Matrix, etc.)
- Those who have expressed explicit interest in the club, but are unable to consistently
  interface with it due to personal constraints.
- Other examples left to the officers' discretion.

Active membership is awarded to any and all currently-enrolled students of the Ohio
State University who display activity within the organization to a recognizable degree. This includes,
but is not limited to:

- Those who attend two or more in-person meetings in a semester
- Those who are active in existing social groups (Discord, Revolt, Matrix, etc.)
  - "Active" is loosely defined as contributing enough to online discussion so as to easily
    be precisely identified and recalled by members during in-person meetings, be it by
    username or reference to disccusions of which the member in question was a part. A more
    precise definition is left to current officership discretion.
- Other examples left to the officers' discretion.

In order to foster a sense of welcoming and accessibility, the only tangible difference between
passive and active membership will be voting and candidacy priveleges for officer roles, as well
as voting priveleges in the removal of executive members.

Neither for passive membership, nor active membership, will any fee or due be required to be
considered a member of the Open Source Club.

## Article III - Procedures for Removing Members and Officers

In the case that a member of this organization is observed
to behave in a way incongruent with Ohio State University Standards, the Student Code of Conduct,
the Non-Discrimination Policy
as expressed in Article I, or in any other way deemed unacceptable by the standards of this organization
and its membership, the member in question will be subject to removal from this organization
by the policies proceeding:

### Section I - The Removal of a Non-Officer

Non-officer members being considered for removal will be notified of this consideration,
whereafter a one-week voting period open to active members, passive members, and officers
will commence.
The removal will be successful if:

- A unanimous decision to remove is made among the officers.
- A simple majority decision to remove is made among passive and active members, separately.

### Section II - The Removal of an Officer

Officer members being considered for removal will be notified of this consideration,
whereafter a two-week voting period open to active members will commence.
The removal will be successful if:

- A 2/3 majority decision to remove is made among active members.

### Section III - Calculating Majorities

Voting abstentions among voting-abled members are not considered in the calculation of a majority.
They are, however, considered in the calculation of a unanimity.

## Article IV - Officer Organization

### Section I - Titles and Duties

The **President** of the OSC will be required to oversee basic functioning of the organization.
The President will remain in charge of deciding meeting times, locations, and topics; of
establishing or disestablishing social media accounts and virtual social groups; of representing
the OSC both in and out of the OSU campus.

The **Vice President** of the OSC will assist the President in the functioning club, and be
delegated individual roles when appropriate and agreed upon. (some other stuff, too; Lizzy
can fill this out!)

The **Treasurer** of the OSC will manage and oversee all financial accounts and duties of
the OSC. The Treasurer will remain in charge of overseeing and approving spending when
necessary; of maintained detailed records of organization cashflow.

### Section II - Voting and Tenure

Officer elections are to take place at the end of the semester preceding the semester
for which the vote will be relevant.

Elections for a provided position are to continue, eliminating the least-popular candidate
from the roster each time, until a candidate receives a simple majority of votes (not including
abstentions).

An individual is allowed to run for, and hold, any officer position until they are no longer
a currently-enrolled OSU student.

### Section II - Modifying Officer Positions

In the case of substantial club size change, the current officers may deem it reasonable to create
new officer positions, or eliminate existing ones. In all cases, there must always be at least
the following three positions:

- President
- Vice President
- Treasurer

The exact process for the creation or removal of officer positions is left to the current
officers' discretion. Any changes to the structure of officer positions is to be made
public to the membership during the semester preceding the term in which these changes
would take effect.

## Article V - Advisor Selection

Advisors of student organizations must be full-time members of the University faculty or Administrative &
Professional staff. Advisors are expected to approve any changes made to the Constitution, Goals,
or other legislature of the organization. They are additionally expected to approve programming
and meeting decisions, as well as budgeting decisions. Advisors are expected to meet with
the officers of the organization at least once per term.

Finally, advisors are encouraged to meet with the officers on a more regular basis, such
as once per month, as well as give general opinions and advice pertaining to the success
of the organization.

## Article VI - Organization Meetings

While meeting attendance is not explicitly required to be a member of this organization (excepting
active membership), it is highly encouraged. In-person meetings shall occur no less
than two times in a semester, pending extenuating public health considerations, individual, communal,
municipal, or otherwise.

It is a stated goal of the OSC to perform collaborative meetings with other organizations.
Whether and which of these meetings are considered official OSC meetings is left to the
discretion of the current officers.

## Article VII - Management of Organization Assets

### Section I - Physical Assets

All physical assets are to be stored and cared for in a location agreed upon by the current
officers.
