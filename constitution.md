# Open source Club Constitution

## Preamble

The Open Source Club at The Ohio State University has had an extensive role in OSU's tech-related
student life, from sprouting into other clubs and events, to encouraging students and alumni alike
to become a part of the open source community.

The current leadership of this organization would like to extend gratitude to former members and staff;
open source has had a rich history, both in and out of OSU's campus, and it is with the support of those
who have come before us that we are able to exercise this passion so freely.

The current staff of the Open Source Club would like to acknowledge the following past members and staff for their contributions:

- Isaac Jones
- Martin Jansche
- Michael Benedict
- Andrew Cziryak
- Kyle Rosenberg
- Adrian Vovk
- Dominik Winecki

## Article I - Definition

### Section I - Name
The name of this student organization is to be "The Open Source Club at The Ohio State University."
("The Open Source Club", "OSC", "th(e/is) organization", "th(e/is) student organization")

### Section II - Purpose
This student organization will dedicate itself to introducing the open source model of
development to students; to showcasing projects developed under an open source development
model (programs, games, websites, etc.); to fostering interest in the open source community;
to allowing students to engage in discourse with other students on the topics surrounding
open source; to raising awareness of the value open source can provide people from all
walks of life; to introduce, promote, and potentially normalize a more democratic use and
development of the technology that surrounds us and will continue to do so for the years
to come.

### Section III - Non-Discrimination Policy
This organization does not discriminate on the basis of
age, ancestry, color, disability, gender identity or expression, genetic information,
HIV/AIDS status, military status, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation,
protected veteran status, or any other bases under the law, in its activities, programs,
admission, and employment.

In addition, this organization does not discriminate on the basis of academic standing,
program affiliation, nor personal political affiliation.

Finally, it is this organization's policy that these statements and policies extend to - and
will be required of - all individuals who choose to associate with this organization; student,
officer,  or otherwise.

## Article II - Membership
Passive membership is awarded to any and all individuals who display interest in the organization
to a recognizable degree. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Those who subscribe to any existing mailing lists.
- Those who interact with any existing social media accounts.
- Those who are members of any existing social groups (Discord, Revolt, Matrix, etc.)
- Those who have expressed explicit interest in the club, but are unable to consistently
interface with it due to personal constraints.
- Other examples left to the officers' discretion.

Active membership is awarded to any and all currently-enrolled students of the Ohio
State University who display activity within the organization to a recognizable degree. This includes,
but is not limited to:

- Those who attend two or more in-person meetings in a semester
- Those who are active in existing social groups (Discord, Revolt, Matrix, etc.)
- Other examples left to the officers' discretion.

In order to foster a sense of welcoming and accessibility, the only tangible difference between
passive and active membership will be voting and candidacy priveleges for officer roles, as well
as voting priveleges in the removal of executive members.

Neither for passive membership, nor active membership, will any fee or due be required to be
considered a member of the Open Source Club.

## Article III - Procedures for Removing Members and Officers

In the case that a member of this organization is observed
to behave in a way incongruent with Ohio State University Standards, the Student Code of Conduct,

and its membership, the member in question will be subject to removal from this organization
by the policies proceeding:

### Section I - The Removal of a Non-Officer
