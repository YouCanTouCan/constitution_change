# OSU Open Source Club Constitution Repository

This repository exists for the purposes of making incremental changes - and logging said
changes - to the official constitution of the Open Source Club at the Ohio State University.

## You're on the `nightly` branch.

This branch is for changes to the constitution as a result of rapidly-changing management
decisions and asset creation/maintenance during the first few terms of OSC's revival.
It'll mostly be things like recognizing there's a new email account, transfership of
said account, whether we're self-hosting anything and how to manage *that*, etc.
